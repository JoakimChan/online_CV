    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Joakim and this is my online CV. This project serves as a demonstration of my basic web development skills,
      showcasing single-page, mobile-responsive websites. It also offers insight into who I am for those interested in learning more about me.

      <br>
      Presently, I am based in Stockholm, where I am pursuing studies in the Software Tester program at a vocational university (KYH).
      I am expected to complete this program by the end of May 2025.
